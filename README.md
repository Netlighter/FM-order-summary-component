## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to work with basic markup in CSS, mastered Flexbox, learned how to make proper shadows, and properly place objects within containers.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.current-plan-info {
    background-color: var(--blue-100);
    border-radius: var(--rad-light);

    width: 100%;
    height: 80px;
    padding: 0.75rem;

    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;

    font-size: 14px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to study JS and learn how to embed scripts inside HTML, and learn how to create interactions between the two languages.

### Useful resources

- [BEM methodology resource](https://ru.bem.info/methodology/html/) - This helped me understand what BEM is and why it's cool.
- [CSS BOX-SHADOW Generator](https://active-vision.ru/icon/box-shadow/) - This helped me make a perfect shadow for the main container.
